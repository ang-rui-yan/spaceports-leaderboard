# Spaceports Leaderboard API

As part of my assignment in CS205 Operating Systems with Android, I have created an API server for the game (developed in Java) to call to get the updates for the leaderboard.

### Commands

docker exec -it your_postgres_container_name psql -U your_username -d your_database_name
